# Wedding_Name_Tags
A LaTeX script to create name tags for actually any purpose, but I created it for our wedding.

With this LaTeX script you can easily create print-ready name tags with cut margin from a csv-file. In case you only have xls or xlsx, you need to open that and export it as csv first. You might need to replace ',' with ';' in notepad for example depending on the settings of Excel. I recommend LibreOffice anyway.

If you have any problems, try my Easy LaTeX Introduction first. If you still have troubles or this solution doesn't help you, please open an issue here.
